  <div class="story-wrapper svelte-1lbnokh"><h1>Baba Saratu</h1>
    <p class="svelte-1lbnokh">Baba Saratu is a happy and proud businesswoman who is married with two children aged 16 and 9 years old. For the past 8 years Saratu has been selling cloth in the Garu market.</p><p class="svelte-1lbnokh">Saratu’s business was very good until inflation hit Ghana hard. She needed extra working capital to sustain her business. She heard about C.A Micro Loans from a friend and decided to request a loan of 2,000 GHS. Her request was granted. She used the money to buy extra stock of cloth to sell.</p><p class="svelte-1lbnokh">After investing the loan amount into her business, Saratu started sending her goods to other nearby community markets in the Garu area. She was able to repay her first loan in full and on time and is now on her fourth loan cycle. Her customer base has increased and the profit she makes has doubled. She can take good care of her children and pay their school fees. Her confidence has increased, and she is financially independent of her husband. That’s important because Saratu is a co-wife.</p><p class="svelte-1lbnokh">Saratu is planning to expand further by adding tailoring materials such as needles, thread, zips, lining materials and scissors into her cloth business. She is optimistic that one day she can build a house for her children and herself so they can have a normal home life.</p></div>
