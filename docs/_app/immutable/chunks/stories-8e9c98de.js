Her mother left behind a provision store for Mary to manage. Unfortunately, her mum\u2019s funeral expenses took almost all the working capital of the store. This meant Mary had to close her store; she was devastated and worried about what the future would look like for herself and her siblings.","But it does not have to be this way. People can work their way out of poverty with a simple loan; this is why C.A. Micro Credit is on a mission to provide easily accessible loans for women to empower themselves.","C.A Micro Credit granted a loan of GHS2,000.00 ($150) to help Mary with her mum\u2019s provision store business. She invested the whole amount into the store, and after 6 months, she paid back the loan in full, leaving a net profit of GHS800.00 ($57.00).","Today, her provision store is always stocked with goods and attracts many customers. She makes a profit of about $60.00 every month which is used to buy food, and pay hospital bills and school fees for her siblings. Mary's successful business has brought much joy and happiness to herself and her family. Mary's dream is to grow the business into a supermarket and support her brother with education to become a carpenter.","Mary has learnt how to manage her credit and is advising others on how to manage theirs. This is helping others to pay back their loans and work their way out of poverty.

She is 67 years old and has been a food vendor for 15 years. Ramatu is married to a husband who cannot work due to sickness from old age. This leaves Ramatu all alone with the burden of her family\u2019s responsibilities. Unfortunately, she lost all her working capital during the Covid-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this, Ramatu needed financial assistance, however, because of her level of education this was unattainable. She became very worried as to how she would take care of her sick husband.","As a hardworking woman who cares very much about her sick husband and always wants to put a smile on his face, she resorted to selling charcoal, which was not generating enough income to pay for vital medication.","But it does not have to be this way. Women should be given the chance to have access to financial support, grow and start a business no matter their educational level. This is why C.A. Micro Credit is on a mission to provide easily accessible financial support to women so that: 'no bankable poor should be left behind.'","C.A. Micro Credit offered her a loan of GHS1,500.00 ($100.00) to restart Ramatu's food vendor business. Today, Ramatu makes about GHS800.00 ($54.00) income every month which is used to take care of her husband\u2019s medication and buy food for her family. She has restored hope and happiness in her husband, which is improving her husband\u2019s condition.","Hopefully, one day she will be able to grow her food vendor business into a restaurant, employ people to work and earn some income as well as take good care of her family.","To support the numerous women out there like Ramatu to achieve their dreams and support their families, we are planning to increase our loan size from GHS2000.00 ($150) to GHS5000.00 ($350) per client and our client base from 150 to 500 clients."]},{title:"Karim Zenabu",subtitle:"Karim Zenabu empowers women entrepreneurs in Ghana through her successful soya bean cake business.",imageURL:"/images/stories/KARIM_ZENABU.jpg",text:["Did you know that most women in polygamous marriages in Ghana are responsible for taking care of their own children?","Meet Karim Zenabu, a busy mother of four children who lives in Garu in the Upper East region of Ghana. She is married with two co-wives. Ramatu is in the soya bean cake business and has been in this business for the past five years. She said her business was successful until the prices of goods and services went up, and she made little profit from the business due to inadequate working capital. As a polygamous married woman, it is her responsibility to take care of her children's school fees, hospital bills, and feed and clothe them. Zenabu said she applied for a loan from a formal bank to expand her business and increase her income level, but her loan request was not granted because she could not provide collateral/guarantors for the loan. She became worried about the future and almost lost hope. According to her, she could no longer carry out her family's responsibilities, which affected her relationship with her children.","C.A. Micro-Credit came along the line and supported her with a loan of GHS1,000. She used GHS500 to buy soya beans, GHS245 to buy 12.5 liters of cooking oil, GHS200 to buy firewood, and GHS55 for other ingredients for her business. For a period of six months, she repaid her loan and had a net profit of GHS600 extra income compared to previously. She said the extra income was used to buy food, pay her children's school fees, and partly invest in her business.",'Zenabu is on her second loan cycle and doing very well in her soya bean cake business.

She expressed how joyful she feels each time her children call her "sweet mummy."',`She plans to build a soya bean cake factory in the future and employ and train young girls who have dropped out of school to have a hand in work and work their way out of poverty and be financially independent. She said she has not forgotten her dream to build a house for herself and her children so they can have a comfortable and peaceful home. Zenabu advises her colleagues to focus on reinvesting their profits in their businesses instead of using it to buy expensive clothes and jewelry. She believes that a woman's freedom and dignity depend on her level of income. Finally, she said, "I am most grateful to the Almighty God and C.A.

She can recall that a company called DEKI came and supported them with loans to expand their businesses but left. Since then, she has not been able to acquire loans from formal banks because she has no collateral or guarantors to acquire a loan from formal banks. She said it affected her income level and family life badly. She could no longer support her children\u2019s schooling, and because of that, four of her children had to drop out of school. Ramatu lamented bitterly how her children were bullied and disrespected by their schoolmates because they were not always in good school uniforms and sandals. Her husband is alive but does not support her to take care of her children. She said she has been taking care of the family for the past 28 years, and it has not been easy for her until she heard about C.A Micro Credit from a community member who is a customer of C.A Micro Credit. She said her friend advised her to enroll with C.A Micro Credit. She did and applied for a loan of GHS1,500, and it was approved for her. According to her, she used GHS400 to buy fertilizer for her maize farm, GHS150 to hire labor, GHS800 to buy gari, sugar, biscuits, pencils, and so on to sell, and GHS50 as transportation costs.","She said for a period of eight months, she repaid her loan, including the loan interest, and had a profit of GHS1,250.

She now has a happy family and is hopeful that, with financial support from C.A Microcredit and hard work, she would be able to stock her store fully and train her children in school so she can enjoy the fruits of her labor when she finally ages.
